## 2026-07-13 — Reproducible Fabric and Node baseline

### What Was Implemented
- Added a reproducible Fabric 26.1.2 project using Gradle 9.5.1 and Java 25.
- Added common and client Fabric entrypoints with build-time entrypoint verification.
- Added a dependency-free Node.js coordinator package with built-in test and start scripts.
- Added a forward-compatible `verifyCore` lifecycle task for the Task 2 verification main.
- Added proprietary licensing and exclusions for generated runtime data, logs, credentials, and local agent state.

### Files Modified
- `.gitignore` — excludes generated build/runtime data, credentials, logs, and local tool state.
- `settings.gradle` — configures Fabric plugin resolution and the project name.
- `build.gradle` — configures Loom, Java 25, dependencies, packaging, publishing, and verification tasks.
- `gradle.properties` — pins the approved Minecraft, Fabric, Loom, API, and project versions.
- `gradle/wrapper/*`, `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat` — adds the official Fabric 26.1.2 Gradle 9.5.1 wrapper.
- `LICENSE` — records the project as proprietary and all rights reserved.
- `src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json` — defines mod metadata, entrypoints, and dependency requirements.
- `src/main/java/dev/agaminggod/arenaagents/ArenaAgents.java` — adds the common Fabric entrypoint.
- `src/client/java/dev/agaminggod/arenaagents/client/ArenaAgentsClient.java` — adds the client Fabric entrypoint.
- `coordinator/package.json` — adds dependency-free Node.js lifecycle scripts.
- `PROJECT_LOG.md` — records this implementation and its deferred work.

### Assumptions Made (flag these for review)
- None. Licensing, ignore rules, entrypoint behavior, and the no-test `verifyCore` behavior were explicitly confirmed before implementation.

### Known Issues / Deferred
- `verifyCore` intentionally skips with a clear message until Task 2 adds `VerificationMain`.
- `coordinator/src/main.mjs` is deferred to the coordinator implementation task; the baseline test entrypoint already succeeds with zero tests.

### Suggested Next Steps
- Implement Task 2's shared protocol records, strict codec, and dependency-free Java verification assertions using TDD.
